    <p>Hi! Welcome to The Hudson Objective.</p>
    <p>
        This site is a simple placeholder / landing page for www.hudsonobjective.com.

    <p>
        It's an evolving space for ideas, experiments, and small business concepts — with an emphasis on clarity, craft, and long-term value. 
        More to come. In the meantime, feel free to connect on LinkedIn (soon), Instagram (soon), Shopify (soon).
